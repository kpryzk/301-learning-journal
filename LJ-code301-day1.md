# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Yesterday was the first day of 301! I was surprised that the lecture didn't begin until 13:00, and because I'd already completed pre-work I mostly just spent the time catching up with my classmates. Unfortunately, this slow start meant that by the time evening lab rolled around, I was well aware of how my sleep schedule had shifted in the week off, and headed home immediately. Bold move, considering I then spent way too long trying to figure out the correct HTML reading docs on how to post a hamburger menu icon on my portfolio page. I finally settled on <span>? And then decided I didn't like it on my personal profile, anyway.

I was impressed with how relatively easy it is to remove and change elements on the page using media queries and CSS! I am just unsure which sizes are best to use, a thing that I am sure there are good references about.
