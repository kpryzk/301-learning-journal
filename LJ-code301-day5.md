# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

Today I learned that I can use a JavaScript function that exists in another .js file instead of rewriting lots of code in order to get the same functionality. I also really like the let ___ instead of using var. I have definitely seen it used in the code of others and now that I have used it myself I feel like it makes things look more organized and less cluttered. Great tips, great day!
