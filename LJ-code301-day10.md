# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

On Sunday I came in to work on Code Wars with lots of classmates. I was hoping to use the arrow functions and functional programming methods we learned in class, but still found myself hacking away at things with if/else/for loops. After tackling the lab assignment, I think I feel more lost than I was when I started. I need to spend more time with what I can tell is a simplified way to write code, but I find myself having a hard time with the syntax. Practice makes perfect or whatever?
