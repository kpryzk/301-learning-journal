# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

Yesterday was Heroku! My pair programming partner and I used worst practice and worked on the master branch, thus avoiding the really intense issues others were experiencing when working on branches. We finished pretty quickly, and I feel like I have  pretty good understanding of the functionality. I then spent time working on my Day 12 portfolio assignment, adding my github repo. I hated it, and really didn't want to do it, and it took me so much less time to do it than I spent complaining about it.
